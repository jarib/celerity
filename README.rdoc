== Description

Celerity is a JRuby library for easy and fast functional test automation for web applications.

Celerity is a JRuby wrapper around HtmlUnit â€“ a headless Java browser with
JavaScript support. It provides a simple API for programmatic navigation through
web applications. Celerity provides a superset of Watir's API.

== Features

* *Fast*: No time-consuming GUI rendering or unessential downloads
* *Scalable*: Java threads lets you run tests in parallel
* *Easy to use*: Simple API
* *Portable*: Cross-platform thanks to the JVM
* *Unintrusive*: No browser window interrupting your workflow (runs in background)

== Requirements

* JRuby 1.2.0 or higher
* Java 6

== Install

    jruby -S gem install celerity

To always get the latest version, you should use Gemcutter as your primary gem source:

    jruby -S gem install gemcutter
    jruby -S gem tumble
    jruby -S gem install celerity


== Example

    require "rubygems"
    require "celerity"

    browser = Celerity::Browser.new
    browser.goto('http://www.google.com')
    browser.text_field(:name, 'q').value = 'Celerity'
    browser.button(:name, 'btnG').click

    puts "yay" if browser.text.include? 'celerity.rubyforge.org'
